    <h1>Popups are Horrible UX</h1>

    <p>
      When users are using your product they are on a mission they want to complete.
    </p>

    <p>
      They are not interested in reading a block of text to use your product that is now behind it.
      It is not because the information is useless, it is because humans can not read, remember and
      apply information presented to them in large chunks.
    </p>

    <p>
      The knowledge gap of a user and the information you provide have very little overlap.
      Therefore it is extremely unlikely a user will be motivated enough to read all you wrote without dropping attention.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Humans have been taught to dismiss popups as a knee-jerk reaction.</li>
      <li>Popups have no intuitive way to be re-raise by the user when needed.</li>
      <li>Popups blocks the context needed to understand the text they prevent.</li>
      <li>Popups forces users to fork their train of thought against their will.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If the information you present to the user is important, it <b>MUST NOT</b> be
      presented in a popup. If it is not important, why present it at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      Minimalism is a virtue. Empower the user with tools that let them find what they need when they need it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tutorial mindset needs to go away.
